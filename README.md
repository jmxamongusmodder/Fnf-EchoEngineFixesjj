## Installation
You must have a [ update to date version of haxe. ](https://haxe.org/download/)
Then,you'll need to follow the fnf source code compilation tutorial,after that you can install LuaJIT
to install LuaJIT copy this:`haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit`on a command prompt/powershell.
So if your lazy as fuck and don't want your mod to be able to run LUA scripts delete "LUA_ALLOWED"line in project.xml.
If you get a error while running lua, run:`haxelib remove linc_luajit`into command prompt/powershell,and then reinstall luaJIT.
If you want video support on your mod, simply do:`haxelib install hxCodec` on a Command prompt/PowerShell.
otherwise, you can delete the "VIDEOS_ALLOWED" Line on Project.xml
